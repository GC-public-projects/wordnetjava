## Presentation
WordNet is a large lexical database of English, organizing words into synsets (sets of synonyms) based on their meanings. Each synset represents a single concept, containing lemmas (base forms of words) and associated POS (Parts of Speech: noun, verb, adjective, adverb). Synsets include glosses (definitions) and examples. Words are linked via semantic relations like hypernyms (parents), hyponyms (children), antonyms, and more. The hierarchy starts with POS, which contains index words pointing to synsets, each storing lemmas and their relationships. This structure helps navigate word meanings and relationships efficiently.

This is the Java version workable in a Kotlin Jetpack compose app
